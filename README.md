## Randomized Queues and Deques

Project done for an upper-level CSC course. Contains a randomized queue, a deque, and a test client. This was made using [the algs4 library](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).

For more information on the project purpose and process, see the readme.txt file.

## Usage
Both RandomizedQueue.java and Deque.java have their own test client methods. Subset.java takes an integer argument k and reads in N strings from StdInput. It then prints out exactly k of the strings in uniformly random order.
